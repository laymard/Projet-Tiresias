# Ideas pick

## Generators we can use

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a typed javascript made by Microsoft.
* [Ruby2Js](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js#ruby), transcompilers from ruby2Js


*Lol Languages*
* [DogeScript](https://dogescript.com/) : so typed, much elegant, Wow
* [TrumpLang](http://trump-lang.surge.sh/) : make JS great Again
* [Hodor Lang](http://www.hodor-lang.org/) : HODOR !!!

## Guidelines

* Compare ruby to Js transcompiler. One ruby source code, and testing on multiple generated Js files.
* Make a Java program which launches a js program with [Process](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Process.html)
* Get an input file which specifies for each programm the inputs, expected and output.
* Compare the outputs with an expected output
